## Implementation Pattern

All protected endpoints follow this consistent pattern:

```typescript
import { requireCSRFToken } from '@/lib/csrf-protection';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // SECURITY: CSRF Protection
  const csrfError = requireCSRFToken(request);
  if (csrfError) return csrfError;
  
  // ... rest of handler logic
}
```

## Security Features

### Multi-Layer Protection
CSRF protection integrates seamlessly with:
- ‚úÖ Authentication (verifyAuth, verifySession, JWT)
- ‚úÖ Authorization (admin role checks)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting (distributed Redis-based)
- ‚úÖ reCAPTCHA v3 (contact forms)
- ‚úÖ Anomaly detection (uploads)
- ‚úÖ Input validation (schemas)

### Token Generation & Validation
- Server-side token generation on session creation
- Double-submit cookie pattern
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Per-session token binding
- Automatic token rotation on auth state changes

## Excluded Endpoints (Intentional)

### External Webhooks (3 endpoints)
These endpoints receive requests from external services and use alternative security:
- `/api/bold/webhook/route.ts` - Bold payment webhook (signature verification)
- `/api/webhooks/messagebird/route.ts` - MessageBird webhook (signature verification)
- `/api/cron/membership-renewals/route.ts` - Cron job (API key authentication)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Verify CSRF token in session cookie
2. Test protected endpoints without token (should fail)
3. Test with invalid token (should fail)
4. Test with valid token (should succeed)
5. Test token expiration and renewal

### Automated Testing
Consider adding integration tests for:
- Token generation on login
- Token validation on protected routes
- Error responses for missing/invalid tokens
- Token rotation on security events

## Performance Impact

- Minimal overhead: Single token lookup per request
- No database queries for validation
- Constant-time comparison (prevents timing attacks)
- Session-based storage (already in memory)

## Compliance

This implementation helps meet security standards:
- ‚úÖ OWASP Top 10 - A01:2021 (Broken Access Control)
- ‚úÖ OWASP CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet compliance
- ‚úÖ PCI DSS Requirement 6.5.9 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- ‚úÖ GDPR security requirements (Article 32)

## Maintenance

### Adding New Endpoints
When creating new POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH endpoints:
1. Import: `import { requireCSRFToken } from '@/lib/csrf-protection';`
2. Add validation at handler start: 
   ```typescript
   const csrfError = requireCSRFToken(request);
   if (csrfError) return csrfError;
   ```
3. Place BEFORE business logic, AFTER route params

### Monitoring
Watch for these in logs:
- `[SECURITY] CSRF validation failed` - Potential attacks
- Failed validation patterns (multiple from same IP)
- Token generation errors (session issues)
