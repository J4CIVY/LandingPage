## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS & TRADE-OFFS

### Acceptable Security Trade-offs
1. **CSP allows 'unsafe-inline'** (DOCUMENTED)

   - Mitigated by comprehensive input sanitization
   - Recommended: Implement CSP nonces in future

2. **IP-based Rate Limiting** (DOCUMENTED)
   - Can be bypassed with proxy rotation
   - Mitigated by multiple layers (IP + account lockout)
   - Recommended: Add CAPTCHA for suspicious behavior

3. **Timing Attack on Login** (LOW RISK)
   - Different response times for valid/invalid users
   - Low risk due to public membership nature
   - Recommended: Add random delay for consistency
