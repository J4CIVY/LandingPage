# üîí Security Policy - BSK Motorcycle Team

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and policies implemented in the BSK Motorcycle Team web application. Security is a top priority, and we follow industry-standard practices to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Token Security
- **Strong Secret Requirements**: Application enforces environment variables for JWT secrets (no default values)
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire after 15 minutes, refresh tokens after 7 days
- **Token Rotation**: Automatic token refresh mechanism implemented
- **Secure Cookie Storage**: HTTPOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies for token storage
- **Session Management**: Maximum 5 active sessions per user with automatic cleanup

#### Password Security
- **Encryption**: RSA-OAEP 2048-bit encryption for password transmission
- **Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds for password storage
- **Strength Validation**: Enforced minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Account Lockout**: Temporary lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- **Common Pattern Detection**: Prevents use of common passwords like "password123"

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Email verification required before account activation
- Security alerts for new device logins
- Session-based device tracking

### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Protection

#### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs sanitized on both client and server side
- HTML entity encoding for special characters
- Maximum length restrictions on all text fields
- Recursive sanitization for nested objects

#### Output Encoding
- Safe usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` only for:
  - JSON-LD structured data (with sanitization)
  - Critical inline CSS (static, no user input)
- React's built-in XSS protection for all dynamic content
- Sanitization functions applied to breadcrumbs and structured data

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP headers configured in `next.config.mjs`
- `script-src` restricted to trusted domains only
- `object-src` set to 'none'
- `frame-ancestors` set to 'none' (clickjacking protection)
- `upgrade-insecure-requests` enabled
- `block-all-mixed-content` enabled

### 3. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection

- **SameSite Cookies**: All authentication cookies use `SameSite=Strict`
- **Origin Validation**: Server validates request origins
- **State Tokens**: Form submissions include time-based tokens
- **Double Submit Cookie Pattern**: Implemented for critical operations

### 4. SQL/NoSQL Injection Prevention

- **Parameterized Queries**: All MongoDB queries use parameterized inputs
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas validate all inputs before database operations
- **ORM Usage**: Mongoose provides additional protection layer
- **Input Type Enforcement**: Strict type checking on all database operations

### 5. Security Headers

Comprehensive security headers configured in `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Content-Security-Policy: [Comprehensive CSP]
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), ...
X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: on
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
```

### 6. Rate Limiting

- **Login Attempts**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **API Endpoints**: Configurable limits per endpoint
- **Image Uploads**: 3 uploads per minute per IP
- **Form Submissions**: Custom limits based on action sensitivity

### 7. File Upload Security

#### Image Uploads
- **Authentication Required**: All uploads require valid authentication
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed image types (JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF)
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum 10MB per image
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Sanitized folder paths with whitelist
- **Content Type Verification**: Server-side MIME type validation
- **Cloudinary Processing**: All images processed through secure CDN

#### PDF Uploads
- **Size Restrictions**: Maximum file size enforced
- **Type Validation**: Strict PDF MIME type checking
- **Virus Scanning**: Recommended for production (integrate with service)

### 8. Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance

- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary user data
- **Consent Management**: Cookie banner with granular consent options
- **Right to Access**: Users can download their data via `/api/user/download-data`
- **Right to Deletion**: Account deletion endpoint with data purge
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Privacy Policy**: Comprehensive privacy policy available
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions and tokens

### 9. Secure Communication

- **HTTPS Only**: Application enforces HTTPS in production
- **TLS 1.2+**: Minimum TLS version enforced
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security with preload
- **Certificate Pinning**: Recommended for mobile apps

### 10. Dependency Security

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated regularly
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential packages included
- **Lock Files**: Package-lock.json committed for reproducibility
- **Security Plugins**: ESLint security plugin enabled

## üö® Vulnerability Fixes Applied

### Critical Fixes

1. **Removed Default JWT Secrets** (CRITICAL)
   - Enforced environment variable requirement
   - Application fails to start without proper secrets
   - File: `lib/auth-utils.ts`

2. **Authentication Bypass Prevention** (HIGH)
   - Centralized authentication using `verifyAuth()` function
   - Consistent token validation across all API routes
   - Fixed inconsistent JWT verification in `/api/users/profile`

3. **File Upload Authentication** (HIGH)
   - Enforced authentication for all file uploads
   - Added path traversal prevention
   - Whitelisted allowed upload directories
   - File: `app/api/upload-image/route.ts`

### High Priority Fixes

4. **XSS in Structured Data** (HIGH)
   - Added sanitization to JSON-LD structured data
   - Removed script tags and dangerous content from user inputs
   - Files: `components/shared/StructuredData.tsx`, `components/shared/Breadcrumbs.tsx`

5. **Password Exposure in localStorage** (HIGH)
   - Removed password fields from localStorage auto-save
   - Added explicit checks to prevent sensitive data storage
   - File: `app/register/page.tsx`

6. **Input Sanitization Enhancement** (MEDIUM)
   - Added length limits to all user inputs in profile updates
   - Type coercion to prevent injection attacks
   - File: `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`

### Medium Priority Fixes

7. **Missing Input Validation** (MEDIUM)
   - Enhanced Zod schemas with maximum length constraints
   - Added recursive sanitization for nested objects
   - File: `lib/validation-schemas.ts`

8. **Image Optimization Security** (MEDIUM)
   - Disabled `dangerouslyAllowSVG` for image optimization
   - Set `unoptimized: false` to ensure processing
   - File: `next.config.mjs`

## üîê Environment Variables Security

### Required Environment Variables

**CRITICAL - Must be set in production:**
```bash
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret-min-32-chars>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<strong-random-secret-min-32-chars>
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
```

**Recommended:**
```bash
SESSION_SECRET=<additional-encryption-secret>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<cloudinary-secret>
SMTP_PASS=<email-password>
```

### Secret Generation

Generate strong secrets using:
```bash
# Linux/Mac
openssl rand -base64 64

# Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('base64'))"

# PowerShell
[Convert]::ToBase64String((1..64 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Minimum 0 -Maximum 256 }))
```

### Security Best Practices for Secrets

1. **Never commit secrets to version control**
2. **Use different secrets for development and production**
3. **Rotate secrets every 90 days**
4. **Use environment-specific secret management** (Vercel Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
5. **Limit secret access to necessary personnel only**
6. **Monitor for exposed secrets** (use tools like GitGuardian, TruffleHog)
